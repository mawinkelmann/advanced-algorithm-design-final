# advanced-algorithm-design-final

This project was created and compiled in Eclipse.
To run the project, you must enter the file containing the
room as a command line argument(EX: ./3050_Final room.txt).
Once the program runs it will print out a list of instructions
for each robot to follow, an instruction will either have the
direction for the robot to move of will say "No Move" if the
robot has no where to move at that time. When the robot reaches
the exit the printed instruction will be "END"
