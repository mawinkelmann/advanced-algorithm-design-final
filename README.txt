# advanced-algorithm-design-final

    This project was created and compiled in Eclipse.
To run the project, you must enter the file containing the
room as a command line argument(EX: ./3050_Final room.txt).
Once the program runs it will print out a list of instructions
for each robot to follow, an instruction will include which
direction to move followed by the number of times to move. If 
the robot is not supposed to move then the instruction will say 
"Wait". When the robot reaches the exit the 2 more lines will
print showing how many steps each robot took to reach thier
destination.
